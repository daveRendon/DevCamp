## Objectives
In this hands-on lab, you will set up an Office365 developer subscription, and Azure trial subscription, and an Azure-based virutal machine for the development environment for subsequent labs in the DevCamp.

1. Choose a userid and a `tenant name` for your trial.  In this case I chose `devcampross`, but you 
    can choose anything you'd like, as long as it is unique.  You'll also have to choose 
    a password, and click `Create my account`.  Next you will see this page, which asks
    for a phone verification:

1. After this process is complete, your O365 trial will be set up.  Once that is done, 
    log on to `http://portal.office.com` with the credentials you created earlier. You 
    should see the following screen.  If you'd like to see the welcome tour click `Next`, 
    or simply close the dialog box.

### Exercise 2: Set up Azure trial subscription

1.  Next, we want to set up an Azure subscription, which
    can be accessed via the Azure Active Directory.  At the bottom of the screen, 
    click `Admin centers`, and then click `Azure AD`. This will open up a new browser tab
    showing this page:

    trial subscription:

1. Enter the information about you, and verify your identity by phone.  Also you'll 
    need to verify via credit card.  Your credit card will not be charged unless you
    remove the spending cap from your subscription.

1. Finally after the verification process, you'll have to agree to the terms of the trial
    subscription:
